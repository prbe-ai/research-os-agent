"""Credential detection and span redaction for captured transcripts.

Runs on the researcher's machine at the journal reservation boundary and in
the legacy batch builder. Both apply the same scanner before serialized
transcript content can leave the host.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
------------------------------------------
The previous gate (`app/ingestion/redaction.py`, removed in 0.104.9.0) dropped
645 batches across 206 sessions and 615 of those — 95% — were false positives.
Two heuristics did all the damage:

  * a BARE 40-char base64 window, which any 40-character file path satisfied
    (`/OdysseyPrivate/odyssey/experiments/casp`, H=3.85), and
  * a three-line `NAME=value` window, which ordinary pipeline stdout satisfied.

So this module does NOT run a bare high-entropy sweep. Entropy is only ever
consulted when something ELSE already says "a credential lives here":

  ANCHORED  a credential-shaped KEY NAME immediately precedes the value
            (`aws_secret_access_key = …`, `AWS Secret Access Key [None]: …`)
  PAIRED    a structured credential matched nearby, and the formless half of
            the same credential sits within `_PAIR_WINDOW` characters
            (an AWS access key id and its 40-char secret)

That is the whole design. An AWS secret access key has no format — it is 40
base64 characters and nothing distinguishes it from a checkpoint path — so the
only safe handles on it are its key name and its partner.

PIPELINE

  [1] keyword prefilter       lower(text) scanned ONCE; a rule is considered

      v
  [5] indirect / placeholder  drop `os.environ[...]`, `${VAR}`, `<your-key>`
      |                       — these are references, not credentials
      v
    [Finding(rule, start, end)]

Every finding is replaced in place with `<redacted:{rule}>`. Nothing is ever
dropped: not the value's event, not its batch, not its session. One false
positive costs a mangled string, never a transcript.
