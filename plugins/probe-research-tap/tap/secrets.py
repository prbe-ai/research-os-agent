"""Credential detection and span redaction for captured transcripts.

Runs on the researcher's machine, inside `outbox.build_batch_body`, so a
credential that lands in a prompt or a shell command never leaves the host.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS
------------------------------------------
The previous gate (`app/ingestion/redaction.py`, removed in 0.104.9.0) dropped
645 batches across 206 sessions and 615 of those — 95% — were false positives.
Two heuristics did all the damage:

  * a BARE 40-char base64 window, which any 40-character file path satisfied
    (`/OdysseyPrivate/odyssey/experiments/casp`, H=3.85), and
  * a three-line `NAME=value` window, which ordinary pipeline stdout satisfied.

So this module does NOT run a bare high-entropy sweep. Entropy is only ever
consulted when something ELSE already says "a credential lives here":

  ANCHORED  a credential-shaped KEY NAME immediately precedes the value
            (`aws_secret_access_key = …`, `AWS Secret Access Key [None]: …`)
  PAIRED    a structured credential matched nearby, and the formless half of
            the same credential sits within `_PAIR_WINDOW` characters
            (an AWS access key id and its 40-char secret)

That is the whole design. An AWS secret access key has no format — it is 40
base64 characters and nothing distinguishes it from a checkpoint path — so the
only safe handles on it are its key name and its partner.

PIPELINE

Every finding is replaced in place with `<redacted:{rule}>`. Nothing is ever
dropped: not the value's event, not its batch, not its session. One false
positive costs a mangled string, never a transcript.
