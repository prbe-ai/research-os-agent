# Changelog

## 0.22.0 (unreleased)

### Breaking

**`run.log()` auto-increments `step` when you omit it.** Previously a bare
`run.log({"loss": l})` sent no `step_index` at all and the points landed on the
wall-clock axis. They now land on steps 0, 1, 2, … so the common loop draws a
curve. This silently changes the axis of any existing bare-`log()` call site.

```python
for batch in loader:
    run.log({"loss": loss})        # 0.16.0: no step   0.17.0: steps 0,1,2,…
```

Opt out with an explicit `step=None`, which still means "no step axis":

```python
run.log({"loss": loss}, step=None)   # wall-clock only, as before
```

An explicit `step=i` is unchanged, and now also moves the auto counter past `i`
so mixing the two forms cannot stack a second series on steps already used.
Counters are per metric `kind`, so `log_hw()` never shifts the training curve.

**`run.span()` returns `SpanHandle`, not `str`.** It subclasses `str`, so
comparison, formatting, dict keys and `id=` passthrough are unchanged, and
`copy`/`deepcopy`/`pickle` degrade it to a plain `str`. Only `type(x) is str`
breaks; use `isinstance(x, str)`.

**`client.run()` can now create its parents, but only via `hypothesis=`.** In
0.16.0 it always raised on an unknown slug. Passing `hypothesis=` creates the
experiment (and its project); omitting it is unchanged and creates nothing. A
slug that is a near-miss of an existing one is REFUSED rather than created.

This is SDK-only. **`probe run start` never creates**, on any path — on the CLI
the slug is hand-typed on every invocation, which is where typos come from. Use
`probe project create` / `probe experiment create` there.

### Added

- **Module-level API**: `probe.init()` / `probe.log()` / `probe.log_hw()` /
  `probe.log_artifact()` / `probe.span()` / `probe.finish()` /
  `probe.active_run()`. Logs from anywhere without threading a handle through
  call frames. The binding is a contextvar over a process default, so worker
  threads find the run while a scoped `init()` shadows rather than hijacks. A
  script that exits without `finish()` is closed as `completed` / `failed` /
  `canceled` instead of waiting for the crash reaper.
- **`run.span()` is a context manager**: `with run.span("rollout") as span:`
  stamps both timestamps from one clock, auto-nests children, and closes with a
  terminal status even when the body raises. Spans have no heartbeat and no
  reaper, so one abandoned by an exception previously stayed `running` forever.
- **`client.compare()`**: N runs read back aligned on a shared step axis,
  labelled by petname, with `None` holes rather than truncation to the shortest.
  `.to_pandas()` if pandas is installed; no new dependency.
- **`run.log()` accepts any value type.** Numbers (and bools, numpy scalars, 0-d
  tensors) become metric points; strings, dicts, lists and `None` go to that
  step's record. Previously one non-numeric key raised out of the training loop
  *and* discarded every numeric metric in the same call.

### Fixed

- A non-numeric value in `log()` no longer takes its numeric neighbours with it.
- `log()` no longer reports a spooled metric write as confirmed when the same
  call also wrote a step record.
- `log({})` no longer consumes a step index.
- Span attributes go through the same JSON-safety pass as metrics, so an
  unserialisable value warns instead of raising inside the training loop (and no
  longer displaces the body's own exception on the way out of a `with` block).
- `run.step()` forwards `strict=`; it used to swallow it.
