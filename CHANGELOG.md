# Changelog

## 0.23.0 (unreleased)

### Breaking

**Root `--token`, `--ingest-token`, and `--hmac-secret` flags are removed.**
A secret in argv leaks into shell history and `ps`, and the new background
outbox drainer could never resolve a credential that lived only in one
process's flags. Migrate to the environment variables the SDK already honors
(`PROBE_TOKEN`, `PROBE_INGEST_TOKEN`, `PROBE_HMAC_SECRET`) or a named context
via `probe login`. `probe login --token` (which STORES the credential) is
unchanged; `--base-url` and `--spool-dir` remain.

**The JSONL spool is replaced by the outbox journal.** Fail-open writes now
land in `~/.local/state/probe/outbox` (override: `PROBE_OUTBOX_DIR` or
`--spool-dir`) as one versioned operation journal (`probe.outbox/1`) with
per-op identity, run tags, context pins, and a content-addressed blob store.
A surviving legacy spool is imported automatically, in order, on first use.
`Client(spool=...)` is gone; pass `journal=` or `spool_dir=`.

### Added

**`--async` / `PROBE_ASYNC=1`: non-blocking writes.** `probe log`, `span add`,
`note add`, `artifact add`, and `run end` queue to the local outbox and return
immediately; a wake-on-enqueue detached drainer delivers with retries and
capped backoff until the queue is empty, then exits. Small files fingerprint
and register upload intent inline (a ~2s-capped presign ping creates the
server's pending row); large files snapshot instantly (filesystem clone where
supported) and hash in the drainer. Failure policy: permanent rejections
dead-letter and the queue keeps flowing; transient failures wait and retry;
401/403 halts delivery with items untouched.

Delivery is **at-least-once**: a crash between the server committing a write
and the journal deleting the op replays it (ops carry an `op_id`; the drain
fsyncs deletions to keep the window minimal, and 409-with-existing_id on a
retry is treated as our own earlier delivery). Scope run refs consistently —
the run-end barrier matches the literal ref you enqueued with (id vs slug).

**`probe outbox status|drain|watch|retry|pause|resume`** — one surface over
the whole queue; `probe flush` is now an alias of `outbox drain`. Every
command prints a one-line stderr banner when the outbox holds dead letters or
is auth-blocked, and `probe doctor` gained an Outbox section. `probe run end`
is a run-scoped barrier: it delivers that run's queued items first and exits
non-zero (without closing the run) while any cannot be delivered.

## 0.22.0

### Breaking

**`run.log()` auto-increments `step` when you omit it.** Previously a bare
`run.log({"loss": l})` sent no `step_index` at all and the points landed on the
wall-clock axis. They now land on steps 0, 1, 2, … so the common loop draws a
curve. This silently changes the axis of any existing bare-`log()` call site.

```python
for batch in loader:
    run.log({"loss": loss})        # 0.16.0: no step   0.17.0: steps 0,1,2,…
```

Opt out with an explicit `step=None`, which still means "no step axis":

```python
run.log({"loss": loss}, step=None)   # wall-clock only, as before
```

An explicit `step=i` is unchanged, and now also moves the auto counter past `i`
so mixing the two forms cannot stack a second series on steps already used.
Counters are per metric `kind`, so `log_hw()` never shifts the training curve.

**`run.span()` returns `SpanHandle`, not `str`.** It subclasses `str`, so
comparison, formatting, dict keys and `id=` passthrough are unchanged, and
`copy`/`deepcopy`/`pickle` degrade it to a plain `str`. Only `type(x) is str`
breaks; use `isinstance(x, str)`.

**`client.run()` can now create its parents, but only via `hypothesis=`.** In
0.16.0 it always raised on an unknown slug. Passing `hypothesis=` creates the
experiment (and its project); omitting it is unchanged and creates nothing. A
slug that is a near-miss of an existing one is REFUSED rather than created.

This is SDK-only. **`probe run start` never creates**, on any path — on the CLI
the slug is hand-typed on every invocation, which is where typos come from. Use
`probe project create` / `probe experiment create` there.

### Added

- **Module-level API**: `probe.init()` / `probe.log()` / `probe.log_hw()` /
  `probe.log_artifact()` / `probe.span()` / `probe.finish()` /
  `probe.active_run()`. Logs from anywhere without threading a handle through
  call frames. The binding is a contextvar over a process default, so worker
  threads find the run while a scoped `init()` shadows rather than hijacks. A
  script that exits without `finish()` is closed as `completed` / `failed` /
  `canceled` instead of waiting for the crash reaper.
- **`run.span()` is a context manager**: `with run.span("rollout") as span:`
  stamps both timestamps from one clock, auto-nests children, and closes with a
  terminal status even when the body raises. Spans have no heartbeat and no
  reaper, so one abandoned by an exception previously stayed `running` forever.
- **`client.compare()`**: N runs read back aligned on a shared step axis,
  labelled by petname, with `None` holes rather than truncation to the shortest.
  `.to_pandas()` if pandas is installed; no new dependency.
- **`run.log()` accepts any value type.** Numbers (and bools, numpy scalars, 0-d
  tensors) become metric points; strings, dicts, lists and `None` go to that
  step's record. Previously one non-numeric key raised out of the training loop
  *and* discarded every numeric metric in the same call.

### Fixed

- A non-numeric value in `log()` no longer takes its numeric neighbours with it.
- `log()` no longer reports a spooled metric write as confirmed when the same
  call also wrote a step record.
- `log({})` no longer consumes a step index.
- Span attributes go through the same JSON-safety pass as metrics, so an
  unserialisable value warns instead of raising inside the training loop (and no
  longer displaces the body's own exception on the way out of a `with` block).
- `run.step()` forwards `strict=`; it used to swallow it.
